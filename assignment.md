## 🧪 Assignment: Functional Test Automation with Playwright + TypeScript

### 🔗 Target Web Application
Explore and automate the following site:
**[https://automationexercise.com/products](https://automationexercise.com/products)**

This page lists a variety of products with prices, titles, and “Add to cart” and “View Product” actions. Your goal is to build a robust UI automation suite that validates core functionality, handles edge cases, and follows best practices.

---

### 📋 Assignment Objectives

- Understand the structure and behavior of the Products page.
- Develop an end-to-end UI test suite using Playwright and TypeScript.
- Focus on functional verification, negative test cases, and modular design.
- Ensure the test suite is **compilation-error free**, **runnable**, and **well-documented**.
